- **Crusades**: Flag-based directive system for strategic operations

### 🏗️ Advanced Features
- Role dispatching via memory-based creep manager
- Strategic automation modules for building, expansion, and resource control
- Structure logic for towers, links, and future lab automation
- Optional enhancements: memory cleanup, task queues, room planning
- Designed for clarity, modularity, and ease of iteration

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
